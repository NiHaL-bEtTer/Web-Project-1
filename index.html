<section id="Description"><h1>Description</h1> <!--this is for the description section of the webpage-->
<p> <strong>Cricket</strong> is <u>bat and ball</u> game between two teams of <strong>11</strong> players. 
    <br> The game involves playing on an <strong>oval-shaped</strong> field that has a central pitch where the <strong>bowler</strong> throws the ball to the batter. <br>
        The team batting attempts to score runs by hitting the ball past the boundary and running between the wickets, <br>but the team fielding attempts to prevent run-scoring and dismiss batters by hitting the batters wickets and other ways. <br>
        Cricket has <u> 3 formats, </u>from short <i>T20s</i> to <i>5 day Test Matches</i> It is particularly popular in India, Australia, England, and Pakistan.

    <p> <!--another paragraph explaining the section-->
        The goat of cricket debate is very subjective, but I personally believe that Virat Kohli is the best player as he has been playing consistently at good averages for a long time now.<br>
            As of February 9th, 2025, <i>Virat Kohli</i> Has scored <strong>27,324</strong> runs in his entire career, placing him 4th on the leader board. <br>Other Great Player Include: Sachin Tendulkar, Ricky Ponting and Kumar Sangakkara. <br>
            <i> Sachin Tendulkar</i> has scored <strong>34357</strong> runs in his career while taking 200 wickets as a spin bowler, he acted like a pillar for the Indian cricket team when hope was lost making him a true gem of cricket.<br> 
            <i>Ricky Ponting</i> has scored <strong>27483</strong> total runs in his career; He is known for his exceptional captaincy and calmness on and off the pitch. Ricky Ponting lead Australia to win the 2003 and 2007 ODI world cups Back-to-back cementing him as a legend to this day. <br>
            <i>Kumar Sangakkara</i> finishes Second on the list with <strong>28106</strong> runs, he was not only an exceptional batsman, but he was also a phenomenal wicket keeper. He aided Sri Lankas&#44; victories in the 2002 champions Trophy as well as the 2014 T20 World Cup.
            <br>Virat Kohli is still an active player being 36 years old, so he still has ample time to achieve the top spot.<br>
